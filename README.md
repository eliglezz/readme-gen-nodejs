## Description
Created to automate the process of writing a readme. This was made using node.js with the inquirer npm package; prompts to input the information. Option to add a screenshot and table of contents can be selected. I had to change how I ran inquirer to get my code to work, ended up with a less complicated, more streamlined solution. More options for a more in depth `README.md` can be added in the future.<br>
## Installation
Fork the repo, Clone the repo, then run `node index.js` in the terminal. Keep in mind your original `README.md`file will be overwritten.<br>
